# Dependency obtainer objects are responsible for holding a dependency's name and the namespace from which the
#  dependency comes from.
# This enables dependants to acquire the dependency later and/or repeatedly which is useful e.g. when the dependant
#  needs to replace the dependency and needs to get an updated reference to the dependency after that.
# The get_dependency(), get_dependencies() and inject_dependencies() methods can return dependency obtainer objects
#  instead of "raw" dependencies using the 'in_obtainer' (get_dependency) or 'in_obtainers' (get_dependencies,
#  inject_dependencies) keyword argument.

# The concept is easier to understand when you compare the following 2 classes:

        #  the dependency provider in this case.
        print("The unstable dependency is:", self._unstable_dependency_obtainer.obtain_dependency())
