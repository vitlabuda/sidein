# Sidein
**Sidein** is a flexible, object-oriented Python dependency injector which hides the boring stuff away and leaves the important things up to you.

[GitHub](https://github.com/vitlabuda/sidein/blob/main/README.md).*


## Features and characteristics
* supports **Python 3.9 and above**
* dependency injection to both regular functions and coroutines
* the ability to decorate functions with dependencies
* support for multiple [namespaces](sidein/ns/NamespaceInterface.py)
* design centered around [dependency providers](sidein/providers/DependencyProviderInterface.py)
  * the ability to create your own dependency provider classes
* [dependency obtainer objects](sidein/obtainer/DependencyObtainerInterface.py)
* thread-safe
* data-type agnostic
* object-oriented
