    # NOTE: As you might've noticed, there is no dependency_exists() method in this interface. The reason for that is
    # that it would encourage its thread-unsafe use. Consider the following code:
    #
    # if container.dependency_exists(name):
    #     container.remove_dependency(name)
    #
    # If two threads executed this piece of code at the same time, a race condition could occur (while the methods
    # exported by this interface are guaranteed to be thread-safe, this doesn't mean they cannot be used wrongly).
    # For this reason, it's reasonable to think of a better, thread-safe method of achieving your goal - a method which
    # doesn't check the presence of a dependency at all; for example, instead of the above code snippet, you could
    # write this:
    #
    # try:
    #     container.remove_dependency(name)  # This method *itself* is guaranteed to be thread-safe
    # except DependencyProviderException:
    #     pass
