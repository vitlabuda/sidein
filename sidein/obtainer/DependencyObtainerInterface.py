    Dependency obtainer objects are responsible for holding a dependency's name and the namespace from which the
     dependency comes from.

    This enables dependants to acquire the dependency later and/or repeatedly which is useful e.g. when the dependant
     needs to replace the dependency provider and needs to get an updated reference to the dependency after that.

    The purpose of this class might be quite tricky to understand just from the above explanation - I recommend you to
     take a look at the examples if you want to make use of this feature.
