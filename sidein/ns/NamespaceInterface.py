        """
        This decorator enables one to decorate functions or methods with a dependency which acts like a decorator.

        Each time (!) a function or method decorated with this decorator is called, the dependency specified in
         the 'name' argument is acquired from the dependency provider. The dependency must be a non-parametrized
         decorator (into which the original function will be passed each time it's called). As with a regular decorator,
         the function returned by the decorator will be called (the arguments passed to the decorated function and its
         return value will stay unchanged). This decorator supports both regular functions and coroutines.
        If the dependency is a parametrized decorator or, for example, a completely different object from which you need
         to extract the decorator, one can pass a function to the 'decorator_extractor' argument. Each time the
         decorated function is called, the acquired dependency is passed to the "decorator extractor" function. The
         return value of that call is going to be used as the non-parametrized decorator instead of the "raw"
         dependency.

        The purpose and usage of this method might be quite tricky to understand just from the above explanation -
         I strongly recommend you to take a look at the examples if you want to make use of this feature.

        :param name: The requested dependency's name. If the 'decorator_extractor' optional argument is left empty, the dependency must be a non-parametrized decorator.
        :param decorator_extractor: A function into which the acquired dependency is going to be passed and whose return value is going to be used as the (non-parametrized) decorator.
