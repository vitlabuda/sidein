        This behavior can have "unexpected" effects, e.g. when a namespace is removed and a new namespace with the same
         name is added to the namespace manager, all functions/methods that have been decorated with the old namespace's
         inject_dependencies() method (note that decorators are evaluated at import-time in most circumstances) will
         still have their dependencies injected from the old, "removed" namespace when they are called (this obviously
         applies to the decorate_with_dependency() method too).
